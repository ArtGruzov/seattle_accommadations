<h3>The motivation for the project</h3>
This repo was made as a part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. 
I decided to do exactly this project because I think that this type of investigation may be interesting. Here I'm investigating  particular qualities of popular and unpopular accommodations in Seattle and trying to find out which months are most popular for placement rent in Seatle and which are not

<h3>A summary of the results of the analysis</h3>
From this analysis, I found out that January and February are the most popular months, while March, October, November, and December are the most unpopular months. Also, from this analysis, I've got characteristics of typical popular/unpopular for rental accommodations. For example, I find out that people prefer to rent an entire apartment or condo with a flexible cancellation policy and with real bad or couch. Moreover, I've found out what areas are most popular and unpopular for rent in Seattle.
